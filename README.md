# Battery Percentage Alert

Get Alerts when laptop charge level is above or below limits - GUI tool for maintaining optimal power level

## Who is this project for?

Most laptop batteries becomes faulty after several years of usage i.e., The charge doesn't decrease gradually. So if the
power source is disconnected, the battery lasts only a few minutes. Without even notifying us, the system will be forced
shutdown leading to interruption in your workflow. This project is meant to be useful for all of us suffering from this
issue.

## What does this project do?

This project throws a notification to the user whenever the charge levels of laptop battery falls below or above the
specified levels. (Useful for maintaining charge at certain levels)
